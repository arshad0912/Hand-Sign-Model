Text â†’ ASL: Data Prep & Label-Based Clip Extraction (Colab)

This repo documents a minimal, reproducible pipeline I used in Google Colab to prepare ASL data and automatically cut labeled segments from a source video using a CSV of timestamps. It also includes optional notes to continue into model fine-tuning later.

What you get

Clean folder structure on Google Drive

Robust ffmpeg-based clip extractor from a CSV (video_path,start,end,label)

Optional: pointers to skeleton extraction and fine-tuning
